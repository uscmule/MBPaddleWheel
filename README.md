# MBPaddleWheel

To assemble print this Paddle wheel you will need one (1) tube and two (2) end caps. Clip seperate from end caps are provided for fit testing.

After the parts are assembled they can be glued in place, or simply use pressure fit.

To get the clips to properly grip a harmonica, the insides of the long surfaces of the clips need to be fitted with 1/4" inch foam pads. The foam grips the nuts holding on the harmonica cover plates on.

## Known Issues
This is a prototype design. It is not very strong, and the clips holding in the harmonicas are not very dependable. The intention of this design is to test the form factor out and provide a starting point for imporivements.

## Future Goals
* Design clips that don't require foam
* Design a tube that can be mic'd and cupped
